-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        I tried to make the colour scheme as simple as possible to avoid disturbing color layouts. 
        I have used 4 main colors:
        - Light grey (Hex: #ab000d) <img src="./assets/img/readme/mp2_light_grey.JPG" height="20px" /> 
        - Dark grey (Hex: #212121) <img src="./assets/img/readme/mp2_dark_grey" height="20px" />
        - Orange (Hex: #ab000d) <img src="./assets/img/readme/mp2_orange.JPG" height="20px" /> 
        - Red (Hex: #212121) <img src="./assets/img/readme/mp2_red.JPG" height="20px" />     
        The color combination was selected on the Material Design website (https://material.io/). I tried to select color combination which is not disturbing and do not bother the visitor, so they stay longer on the site if they wish.
        I also use basic warning or highlighter colors for their main usual meanings (red: not correct, green: correct, orange: selected etc ...) 


    -   #### Typography
        - There are two font families used on the site. Fredoka One and Montserrat. This font combination was selected on the googlefonts website (https://fonts.google.com/).
        There are fallback font families in those cases when the main fonts cannot be loaded for some reason. Cursive is the fallback font in the case of Fredoka One and Sans Serif for Montserrat. Both font families are representing very well the style of the webpage. They seems playfull and happy.      
        Fredoka One is used mainly for headings and titles or in the navigation menu, while Montserrat is used more in the texts and descriptions.
    
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Since the main topic of this website is to focuse on images and comparing them i wanted to keep the surroundings without any picture. I wanted to keep it neutral for the visitor to keep a good focus on the images for comparisation.
